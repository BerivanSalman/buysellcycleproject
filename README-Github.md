**THINGS TO CONSIDER ON GITHUB**

**_PULL OPERATION_**

1- Perform "git pull" on the Main branch.

2- Switch to our own branch and perform "git merge main" operation.

**_COMMIT OPERATION_**

1- Use git add with the modified file path! (Sample: git add src)

2- git commit -m "MM.DD.YY/name-2" (Sample: git commit -m "03.28.24/Yusuf-3")

3- git push

Note: Before each operation, make sure you are not on the main branch. 

If changes are required on the main branch or if any encountered errors need resolution, communicate with the lead.
While adding to Github, never use git add .!
